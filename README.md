Online shop "TOOL STORE". The primary objective of creating a Tools Store website is to facilitate e-commerce activities. Specifically, the creation of an online store for the sale of construction tools, with a focus on both wholesale and retail distribution. The Tools Store website aims to assist businesses and individuals in selecting the appropriate and high-quality products required for their projects.

The home page of the Tool Store website provides a navigation bar where users can choose buttons with the names of pages to quickly navigate to content that interests them. On the right-hand top corner, there are buttons for "registration" and "login" on each website page. The "Homepage" provides useful information and special offers to customers. The "Tools" page contains tables with products categorized by type. The "Contact" page provides contact information and details about store opening hours. The "Delivery" page provides useful information regarding the delivery of products and the table of prices.

Registered users are able to post comments on the website, view them, edit them, and delete them. Comments can be submitted through a login form, which will redirect the user to a "comment" page. Once submitted, the comments will be visible on the "tools" page at the bottom of the website. The "tools" page provides users with a list of comment names. When a user clicks on a comment name, they will be redirected to the corresponding "comment" page, where they can view, edit, or delete that comment. The "logout" button can be found in the top right corner, which can only be seen if the user is logged in.

The special offer products found on the page contain a short description. Users can view them by clicking on them, and they can hide information by performing the same action. The "basket" button is available only to registered users and is located in the top right corner of the screen. When a user clicks on the button, they are redirected to the "basket" page.
